# Planet Simulation Readme

## Description:
This is a Python software known as Planet Simulation which was created using Pygame. It employs Newtonian gravity to emulate how planets move in outer space. Objects in the program are planets which are characterized by properties such as position, velocity, mass, and orbit based on the object-oriented programming model. It has features such as pausing and resuming the simulation, adjusting the simulation speed, and zooming in on the planets. It is presented in a graphical user interface developed with Pygame so that the users can observe the planet orbits and control the simulation with keys.

## Features:
- Simulates the movement of planets based on Newtonian gravity.
- Allows zooming in and out for closer inspection of planets.
- Provides options to adjust the simulation speed.

## Controls:
- **Enter Key:** Select the chosen simulation speed and start the simulation.
- **Up Arrow Key:** Move up in the menu options.
- **Down Arrow Key:** Move down in the menu options.
- **Escape Key:** Return to the main menu from the simulation screen.

## Installation:
1. **Run the setup scripts:**
   - For Windows: Run [windows-install.bat](windows-install.bat).
   - For Unix-like Systems (Linux/macOS): Run [unix-install.sh](unix-install.sh).
2. **Run the game:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files, and run the command `python main.py`.
